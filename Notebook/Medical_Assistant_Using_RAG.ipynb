              " '130 CHAPTER 7 Evidencebased medicine Odds ratios and relative risk What is an odds ratio The number needed to treat NNT is a very useful way of describing the bene ts or harms of treatments both in individual trials and in systematic reviews Few papers report results using this easily interpretable measure However NNT calculations come second to working out whether an effect of treatment in one group of patients is different from that found in the control groups Many studies particularly systematic reviews report their results as odds ratios or as a d in odds ratios and some trials do the same Odds ratios are also commonly used in epidemiological studies to describe the probable harm an exposure might cause Calculating the odds The odds of an event occurring are calculated as the number of events divided by the number of nonevents For example 24 pharmacists are on call in a major city Six pharmacists are called The odds of being called are 6 divided by 18 the number who were not called or 0 33 An odds ratio is calculated by dividing the odds in the treated or exposed group by the odds in the control group In general epidemiological studies try to identify factors that cause harm those with odds ratios 1 For example if we look at case control studies investigating the potential harm of giving high doses of calciumchannel blockers to treat hypertension Clinical trials typically look for treatments that d event rates and that have odds ratios 1 In these cases a percentage d in the odds ratio is often quoted instead of the odds ratio For example the ISIS4 trial reported a 7 d in the odds of mortality with captopril treatment rather than reporting an odds ratio of 0 93 Relative risks Few people have a natural ability to interpret event rates that are reported in terms of odds ratios Understanding risks and relative risks seems to be easier to grasp The risk or probability of being called in the example already described in Calculating the odds is 6 divided by 24 the total number on call or 0 25 25 The relative risk is also known as the risk ratio and if reporting positive outcomes such as improvement it can be called relative bene t Risks and odds In many situations in medicine we can get a long way in interpreting odds ratios by pretending that they are relative risks When events are rare risks and odds are very similar For example in the ISIS4 study 2231 out of 29 022 patients in the control group died within 35 days a risk of 0 077 2231 29 022 or an odds of 0 083 2231 29 022 2231 This is an absolute difference of 6 in 1000 or a relative error of 7 This close approximation holds true when we talk about odds ratios and relative risks provided that the events are rare 07Wiffen Chap07 indd 130 11 2 2011 12 09 28 PM',\n",
              " '131 ODDS RATIOS AND RELATIVE RISK Why use an odds ratio rather than relative risk If odds ratios are dif cult to interpret why don t we always use relative risks instead There are several reasons for continuing with odds ratios most of which relate to the superior mathematical properties of odds ratios Odds ratios can always take values between zero and in nity which is not the case for relative risks The range that relative risk can take depends on the baseline event rate This could obviously cause problems if we were performing a metaanalysis of relative risks in trials with greatly different event rates Odds ratios also possess a symmetrical property if you reverse the outcomes in the analysis and look at good outcomes rather than bad outcomes the relationships have reciprocal odds ratios Again this is not true for relative risks Odds ratios are always used in case control studies where disease prevalence is not known the apparent prevalence depends solely on the ratio of sampling cases to controls which is totally arti cial To use an effect measure that is altered by prevalence in these circumstances would obviously be wrong so odds ratios are the ideal choice This in fact provides the historical link with their use in metaanalyses the statistical methods that are routinely used are based on methods rst published in the 1950 s for the analysis of strati ed case control studies Metaanalytical methods that combine relative risks and absolute risk reductions are now available but more caution is required in their application especially when there are large variations in baseline event rates A fourth point of convenience occurs if it is necessary to make adjustments for confounding factors using multiple regression When measuring event rates the correct approach is to use logistic regression models that work in terms of odds and report effects as odds ratios All of which makes odds ratios likely to be in use for some time so it is important to understand how to use them Of course it is also important to consider the statistical signi cance of an effect in addition to its size as with relative risks it is easy to spot statistically signi cant odds ratios by noting whether their 95 con dence intervals do not include 1 which is analogous to a 1 in 20 chance or a probability of 0 05 or gambling odds of better than 19 1 that the reported effect is solely due to chance Formula to calculate an odds ratio Oddsratiooddsontreatment oddsoncontrol Where odds ratio 1 this implies no difference in effect Formula to calculate a relative risk Riskratioriskontreatment riskoncontro l Where risk ratio 1 this implies no difference in effect 07Wiffen Chap07 indd 131 11 2 2011 12 09 29 PM',\n",

              " '4 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep What Is Sleep Sleep was long considered just a block of time when your brain and body shut down Thanks to sleep research studies done over the past several decades it is now known that sleep has distinct stages that cycle throughout the night in predictable patterns How well rested you are and how well you function depend not just on your total sleep time but on how much sleep you get each night and the timing of your sleep stages Your brain and body functions stay active through out sleep and each stage of sleep is linked to a specific type of brain waves distinctive patterns of electrical activity in the brain Sleep is divided into two basic types rapid eye movement REM sleep and nonREM sleep with three different stages For more information see Types of Sleep on page 5 Typically sleep begins with nonREM sleep In stage 1 nonREM sleep you sleep lightly and can be awakened easily by noises or other disturbances During this first stage of sleep your eyes move slowly your muscles relax and your heart and breath ing rates begin to slow You then enter stage 2 nonREM sleep which is defined by slower brain waves with occasional bursts of rapid waves You spend about half the night in this stage When you progress into stage 3 non REM sleep your brain waves become even slower and the brain produces extremely slow waves almost exclusively called Delta waves',\n",

              " '6 Your Guide to Healthy Sleep You typically first enter REM sleep about an hour to an hour and a half after falling asleep After that the sleep stages repeat them selves continuously while you sleep As you sleep REM sleep time becomes longer while time spent in stage 3 nonREM sleep becomes shorter By the time you wake up nearly all your sleep time has been spent in stages 1 and 2 of nonREM sleep and in REM sleep If REM sleep is severely disrupted during one night REM sleep time is typically longer than normal in subsequent nights until you catch up Overall almost onehalf of your total sleep time is spent in stage 2 nonREM sleep and about onefifth each in deep sleep stage 3 of nonREM sleep and REM sleep In contrast infants spend half or more of their total sleep time in REM sleep Gradually as they grow the percentage of total sleep time they spend in REM contin ues to decrease until it reaches the onefifth level typical of later childhood and adulthood Why people dream and why REM sleep is so important are not well understood It is known that REM sleep stimulates the brain regions you use to learn and make memories Animal studies suggest that dreams may reflect the brain s sorting and selectively storing new information acquired during wake time While this information is processed the brain might revisit scenes from the day and mix them randomly Dreams are generally recalled when we wake briefly or are awakened by an alarm clock or some other noise in the environment Studies show however that other stages of sleep besides REM also are needed to form the pathways in the brain that enable us to learn and remember',\n",

              " '2 PIP Digest Differences between Cancer Cells and Norma l Cells Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive Unlike normal cells that mature into very distinct types with specific functions cancer cells are less specialized which helps them di vide without stopping Cancer cells ignore signals that would otherwise stop them dividing or that begin the process known as programmed cell death or apoptosis Cancer cells influence surrounding normal cells molecules and blood vessels an area known as the microenvironment For instance cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumours with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products Cancer cells often evade or hide from the immune system that would norma lly remove them They can even coopt the immune system to help them grow and stay alive How Cancer Arises Cancer is a genetic disease that is it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function especially how they grow and divide Cancer can be inherited can arise because of errors that occur as cells divide can be caused when DNA is damaged by exposure to environmental factors including chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet radiation from the sun can be caused by epigenetic alterations which affect the behaviour of genes without affecting the genetic structure itself Epigenetic marks switch genes on or off in response to diet stress prenatal nutrition and a wide range of other environmental influences Some epigenetic changes can be passed from one generation to the next Each person s cancer involves a unique combination of genetic changes As a cancer continues to grow additional changes occur A single tumour may contain many different genetic variations In general cancer cells exhibit more genetic changes than normal cells Some changes may be the result of the cancer rather than its cause Drivers of Cancer The genetic origins of cancer tend to arise in two main types of genes oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes These mutations are sometimes called drivers of cancer Altered oncogenes stop regulating cell division allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not Tumour suppressor genes which would normally stop cancer are altered and enable cells to divide uncontrollably When Cancer Spreads In metastasis c ancer cells break away from where they first formed primary cancer travel through the blood or lymph system and form new tumours metastatic tumours in other parts of the body Under a microscope metastatic cancer',\n",
              " '3 PIP Digest cells generally share molecular feat ures with the original cancer including specific chromosome changes For this reason the original and metastatic tumours are considered the same type of cancer For instance breast cancer that metastasizes in the lung is metastatic breast cancer not lung cancer Metastatic tumours can severely damage how the body functions Most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease Most treatments for metastatic cancers are designed to relieve symptoms and control the size of tumours and their further spread But reducing cancer deaths requires curing metastatic disease outright Tissue Changes that Are Not Cancer Not every change in the body s tissues is cancer though many may develop into cancer if they are not treated The diagram on the next page shows the progression of cellular changes that may lead to cancer Hyperplasia occurs when cells within a tissue divide faster than normal and build up or proliferate The cells and the way the tissue is organized look normal under a microscope Hyperplasi a can be caused by chronic irritation or several other factors Dysplasia is more serious than hyperplasia Dysplasia also involves a buildup of extra cells but the cells look abnormal and there are changes in how the tissue is organized In general the more abnormal the cells and tissue look the greater the chance that cancer will form Some types of dysplasia may need to be monitored or treated For example an abnormal skin mole called a dysplastic may turn into melanoma An even more serious condition is carcinoma in situ Carcinoma in situ is not invasive cancer because the abnormal cells do not spread beyond the original tissue But because some carcinomas in situ become invasive they are usually treated Cancer Progression Source 6 Cancer progression from NIH png',\n",
              " '4 PIP Digest Types of Cancer 2 There are more than 100 types of cancer Cancers are usually named for the organs or tissues where they form For example lung cancer starts in lung cells and brain cancer in brain cells Cancers also may be described by the type of cell that formed them such as an epithelial cell or a squamous cell Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer They are formed by epithelial cells which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body There are many types of epithelial cells which often have a column like shape when viewed under a m icroscope Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names Adenocarcinoma forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus Tissues with this type of epithelial cell are sometimes called glandular tissues Most cancers of the breast colon and prostate are adenocarcinomas Basal cell carcinoma begins in the lower or basal base layer of the epidermis or outer layer of skin Squamous cell carcinoma forms in squamous cells which grow just beneath the outer surface of t he skin They also line many other organs including the stomach intestines lungs bladder and kidneys Under a microscope Squamous cells look flat like fish scales Squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes called epidermoid carcinomas Transitional cel l carcinoma forms in a type of epithelial tissue called transitional epithelium or urothelium This tissue made up of many layers of epithelial cells lines the bladder ureters a part of the kidneys called the renal pelvis and other organs Some cancers of the bladder ureters and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas Sarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues including muscle fat blood vessels lymph vessels and fibrous tissue such as tendons and ligaments Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer Common soft tissue sarcomas include leiomyosarcoma Kaposi sarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma liposarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans Leukemias are cancers that begin in the blood forming tissue of the bone marrow also called liquid tumours Large numbers of abnormal white blood cells leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells build up in the blood and bone marrow crowding out normal blood cells and making it harder for the body to deliver oxygen control bleeding and fight infections The four common categories of leukemia are based on how quickly they progress acute or chronic and the type of blood cell they start in lymphoblastic or myeloid Lymphoma begins in lymphocytes T cells or B cells These diseas efighting white blood cells are part of the immune system With lymphoma abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and vessels as well as in other organs There are two main types of lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes called Reed Sternberg cells These cells usually form from B cells 2 Adapted from cancer understanding what iscancer',\n",

              " 'IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS xii Important questions and answers Important questions and answers The diagnostic findings given in this book are based mostly on an im pression of what other doctors expect in the form of evidence for a diag nosis during clinical discussions or in an evidencebased past medical history Ideally these findings should have been shown to form the best combinations that identify patients who respond well to treatment com pared to placebo in clinical trials Failing this they should be the combina tions recognized by convention as being the best known as diagnostic criteria In the absence of both these situations one has to resort to impressions of what most physicians would think reasonable The usefulness of suggestive findings would also require more studies on their frequency of occurrence in association with different diagnostic criteria in various clinical settings 2 Does this book claim to reveal all the mysteries of diagnosis No the way in which our minds work is a mystery as is much of the diagnostic process Diagnosis is based on the Greek to know through In the context of medicine it is to see through the patient s symptoms and other findings to imagine and understand what may be happening in terms of current theories applied to medicine The decision of what to do is made by using the diagnosis to infer what will probably happen next and how the process can be changed by various available interventions Physicians learn to do this by experience so that as they take a history and examine a patient it dawns on them what may be going on what may happen next and what they should do In essence their diagnosis is a title or label for what they are imagining in terms of current processes and future events The process is uncertain Philosophically we can only show that other diagnoses or hypotheses are improbable and that the patient s findings are probably explained by only one known diagnosis However there may be some other processes not yet discovered by basic medical research with which the patient s findings are also compatible There fore the outcomes of actions based on a presumed diagnosis have to be monitored and the diagnosis and decision revised if necessary The proc ess is often cyclical so that the physician is supplementing the patient s own reparative and homeostatic feedback processes The diagnostician has to be alert to new concerns symptoms and other findings and must be able to interpret them to arrive at new diag noses and decisions Surgeons may have to do this as they are operating on a patient what may appear to be a simple routine procedure may produce surprises and require a quick innovative and skilled response Diagnosis is thus bound up with clinical management Physicians depend on such rapid intuitive processes to get through their day with the speed and efficiency required of them In some cases a doctor will listen to the patient conduct an examina tion and decide what to do e g giving a painrelieving drug pressing on a bleeding wound or sending the patient quickly to the hospital without',\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 1 The diagnostic process 2 Introduction On the eve of clinical clerkships, at the end of basic science training, the medical student has mastered more information than he or she will ever again know in a lifetime. Yet it is precisely at this time that developing the clinical scenario is most awkward. Simply put, the problem is one of incompatibility of two sets of knowledge. Medical knowledge comprises millions of facts. It must be organized by disease state and by pathophysiology. Information is easily retrieved, once mastered, if organized by disease state or pathogenesis. Clinical information, obtained from a single patient during the interview and exam, similarly comprises hundreds, if not thousands, of facts. The patient, however, rarely presents as a disease. More commonly, the patient presents as a loosely constructed chain of complaints, each further from the chief complaint, and each of uncertain relation to the other. A patient may present with a chief complaint, accompanied by an elaborate psychological construct to prevent disclosure of painful events. Occasionally the patient presents with a chief complaint accompanied by a distressingly detailed essay on bodily functions and their manifestations in each of the special senses. It is the clinician\\'s job to manage the information obtained during the interview in such a way that the patient\\'s problem is accurately assessed. The difficulty lies in the fact that the vast medical information the student commands is not in an accessible format during the clinical situation. To a certain extent, medical information must be relearned in a clinical format, such as clinical presentations. In other words, the polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin into a gelatinous network that contorts the other- wise supple red cell into an unyielding and obstructive mass can present as fever and shortness of breath in an African-American man (sickle chest syndrome). Relearning the body of information mastered in medical school as presentations is neither efficient nor, in most cases, necessary. Fortunately, there are techniques that enable the budding clinician to make the two bodies of knowledge-the medical information and the patient data-compatible. These techniques are simply thought proc- esses. They aren\\'t unique to medicine, but they comprise much of the fabric of clinical experience. Paradoxically, many seasoned clinicians cannot explain such thought processes well. They are \"second nature,\" like riding a bike or driving a car, only the skills involved pertain to cognition, rather than movement. Students generally learn them by trial and error, by emulation of their instructors, and simply as a product of experience.'),\n",

              "   \"DEVELOPING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 1 3 Developing a differential diagnosis There are two different thought processes involved in the diagnostic and clinical decision-making process. The first is the process of arriving at the diagnosis and the second is explaining and checking the diagnosis. It is very important to recognize this difference. The process of discovering the diagnosis is performed in a systematic way, but the urgency of the situation or disruptive events may frequently result in the planned sequence being abandoned. Diagnoses are arrived at in the form of imagined processes with dif- ferent degrees of certainty. These diagnoses, some tentative, others more certain, will suggest relevant tests to clarify the situation and treatments to try and reverse or divert the course of the diagnoses. This first thought process depends on the individual diagnostician's imagination combined with different types of thought processes ranging from rapid pattern recognition for familiar issues to a more tentative approach when in unfamiliar territory. Students will almost always be in unfamiliar territory at first, and no doctor can become familiar with every situation. Doctors who see many patients will come across unfamiliar problems more often, making medi- cal practice a constant challenge and highlighting the need for a more methodical checking process.\"),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 1 The diagnostic process 4 Problem-solving skills Information processing is a primary goal of the physician–patient interaction. It proceeds in three phases: data processing, hypothesis generation, and creation of a differential diagnosis. The division between these phases is somewhat artificial, but it is practical. Data processing Immediately after the patient encounter, and possibly after reviewing some basic labs and radiographic studies, an accounting of all positive and negative findings takes place. During this phase, the clinician undertakes the process of collecting and examining all the \"findings,\" or data, and analyzing them to look for a common relationship between them. By trying to fit these findings together to make a more accurate hypothesis, the top (or most likely) diagnoses will emerge from this process. Toward that end, a positive finding is an abnormal finding in the patient; a negative finding is either a normal finding that was expected to be abnormal, or the absence of a positive finding that was expected to be present. During early attempts at this type of data analysis, we suggest that you create a table to help you master this process. First, make a list of all positive and negative findings. This step involves the following: - Listing all positive and negative symptoms - Listing all positive and negative physical findings - Listing all positive and negative laboratory findings For example, a positive finding in a patient with chest pain is that the pain is closely associated with exertion and relieved with rest. A negative finding in such a patient would be the absence of relief of the pain with nitroglycerin (because one would expect such a response with chest pain from coronary artery disease). Data processing is also the first step in generation of a problem list. Also, consider each of the following attributes of findings: - Assessment of relevance to the chief complaint. Each finding is exam- ined for its relevance by classifying it as definitely relevant, possibly relevant, or irrelevant (separate problem). - Assessment of reliability (certainty) of each finding. It is normal for findings to be equivocal. Inexperienced clinicians will have many more equivocal findings than will seasoned clinicians, simply because of their lack of experience. However, not all equivocal findings pertain to experience of the clinician. For example, a heart murmur may be equivocal to the most talented cardiologist, simply because that is the nature of the human body. The important thing is to acknowledge equivocal findings when they occur. - Hypothesis generation. This process begins during the patient encounter, often within the first few minutes after the interaction has started. While the clinician is still recording factual information (either in written notes or in memory), various pieces of information rise to the surface.'),\n",

              "   'PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS 1 5 The skills used here are unique in that they are performed while the patient and clinician are speaking or while the clinician is examining the patient. Such skills allow the clinician to process and refine the data as they are obtained. Seasoned clinicians can perform most of thei r problem- solving skills during this phase, and the student will be increas ingly able to do so with experience and practice. The goal of this phase is to develop a hypothesis or working diagnosis (3–4 diagnoses) that might explain the patient\\'s presentation. This working diagnosis will generate a set of questions that the clinician needs to ask. These questions will depend on the manifestations that the disease is expected to produce in a patient. Note that hypothesis generation is not answer generation. The process simply allows the clinician to prioritize possibilities. Clinical decision-making is derived from medical knowledge, personal theories, assumptions, experi- ence, traditions, and lore, and this mental strategy is sometimes called medical heuristics, such as \"gestalt\" and \"string along.\" Skills used during hypothesis generation include consideration of demographics and chief complaint, the limited survey, and pattern recog- nition. We will explore the use of each of these tools briefly. Demographics and the chief complaint Taking into account what is epidemiologically most likely in a given popu- lation, a small amount of information can yield surprisingly accurate hypotheses. For example: - 32-year-old woman with polyarthritis l rheumatoid arthritis - 28-year-old man with thrush l acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Although gender, ethnic, and racial differences are generally de-emphasized to prevent discrimination, in some cases, they are a valid or even necessary consideration: - 28-year-old African-American woman with hilar adenopathy l sarcoi- dosis. (In the United States, sarcoidosis affects blacks 10–20 times more commonly than it does whites. In Europe, the disease more commonly affects whites.) - 22-year-old woman of Mediterranean descent with hemolytic anemia l glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency It is important to consider, however, that the reason for the racial or gender differences may have been biased in the original observations, as is the case for coronary artery disease in women.'),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 1 The diagnostic process 6 Survey of the possible causes This is based on only the initial presentation and accompanying symptoms. It can be taken using one of the formats outlined below. All formats should be used when doing a survey because a single format does not cover everything. Organ system Though these are somewhat artificially divided, they are easily recalled and understood, allowing access to a comprehensive database. Anatomy An anatomy survey is similar to one of an organ system, but concerns the \"finer points\" of anatomy. An anatomy survey lends itself well to the surgical specialties. For example, when considering the differential diag- nosis of nausea and vomiting, consider lesions in the external auditory canal, as the general somatic afferent fibers from this area are carried by the vagus nerve, which also carries parasympathetic fibers to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Pathogenesis The pathological processes that cause disease can be classified, and con- sideration of this classification is helpful in generating hypotheses and differential diagnoses. \"VITAMIN C\" is one useful mnemonic for recalling these mechanisms of disease: V = vascular I = infectious T = toxic or traumatic A = autoimmune M = metabolic I = idiopathic (some call it inflammatory) N = neoplastic or nutritional C = congenital or genetic Pattern recognition The expression \"when you hear hoof beats don\\'t think zebras\" is a reminder that common diagnoses are common and should be considered f ir s t .

Establish the relationship between findings, which may be inter- dependent or mutually exclusive. Findings may also be \"lumped\" instead of \"split.\" Lumping is the most efficient way to begin the problem-solving process and consists of com- bining as many findings as possible into a single category. Splitting the findings into the most appropriate category is a process that \"keeps the clinician honest.\" Specifically, the findings should be attributed to the correct cause. An important rule is that a younger patient will tend to have only one problem explaining all manifestations, whereas an older patient may have multiple problems, each contributing to the presentation. For example, consider the syndrome of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and leg pain. When initially considering this group of symptoms, many clinicians would propose a pulmonary embolism (PE) as the etiology : dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and fever are related to the PE, and the leg pain is from the deep vein thrombosis that caused the PE. However, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and leg pain could also represent pneumococcal pneumonia in a patient, who has leg pain attributed to a basketball injury the day prior to presentation. The choice between these (and other) scenarios might rest on the patient\\'s age or past medical his- tory, or on other features of the history or physical. Some forms of pattern recognition are described next. Clusters This is a group of findings that, when found together, have a rela tively high positive predictive value (i.e., they are specific) for a given finding. For example: - Tremors + tachycardia + weight loss = hyperthyroidism - Polyuria + polydipsia + polyphagia = hyperglycemia - Polyuria + constipation + lethargy = hypercalcemia'),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 1 The diagnostic process 8 Syndrome recognition Syndromes are more specific than clusters-i.e., they are more likely to have only one cause. Often, they are given names or eponyms, For example: - Horner\\'s syndrome: ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos, anhidrosis ipsilaterally - Superior vena cava syndrome: elevated jugular venous pressure, visible anastamotic veins, and reversal of flow of the supraumbilical veins Gestalt While this is a form of cluster, the emphasis is on the relative ease of recognition of the whole picture, rather than a more laborious construc- tion of its parts. The suffix \"-oid\" allows the term to be used with suffi- cient (lack of) precision. The actual diagnosis of a syndrome or disease depends on the component parts and is associated with greater specificity. For example: - Cushingoid habitus = centripetal obesity - Cushing\\'s syndrome consists of truncal obesity, hypertension, fatigability, amenorrhea, hirsutism, purple abdominal striae, edema, glucosuria, and osteoporosis. - Cushing\\'s disease (as described by Cushing accompanying a basophilic pituitary tumor) refers to this syndrome when the cause is specifically a pituitary tumor. Note the increasing specificity from \"Cushingoid\" to \"Cushing\\'s syndrome\" to \"Cushing\\'s disease. Finding a \"key clue\" This will be a \"maximally\" specific clue, almost pathognomonic for a diagnosis in question-for example, the presence of splinter hemor- rhages in the proximal nail beds in bacterial endocarditis. If the other findings fit, then you probably have the diagnosis. If they don\\'t, then look further. (Such specific clues are not that common.) Template matching In this technique, the clinician knows intimately all of the manifestations of a particular disease. She or he will then try to fit the findings of the patient into the possible presentations of that disease. Think of the disease in question as a blueprint, and the findings are added into the blueprint in such a way that they ultimately fit the template. This technique is the one most used by subspecialists, who perform consults to determine whether a patient has a particular disease or not. It is based on the fact that diseases present in multitudes of ways, for reasons that are not always apparent. Weight of evidence When all the findings do not neatly support a diagnosis, one assesses where the \"weight of the evidence\" lies. In other words, if most of the findings support endocarditis, but the blood cultures are negative, the patient is still considered to have endocarditis. However, diagnostic errors can be made when using this technique. See discussion in Dynamic Diagnoses and the Possibility of Cognitive Error, p. 12.'),\n",

Consider, however, that the two clues may be unrelated. Use of algorithms Algorithms are specific for the symptom being addressed. Experienced clinicians use these all the time but keep them recorded only in their minds. Such algorithms that are in frequent use are generally too com- plex to be printed easily (because the branch points are highly detailed). However, simplified versions are very amenable to students\\' use, and can be sought on a case-by-case basis through each subspecialty. \"String-together technique\" This technique involves linkage of one finding to another, e.g. dyspnea and chest pain in a blind, 56-year-old man who was completely healthy until he developed severe back pain from a ruptured disc. Heavy ibupro- fen use for the pain led to gastric ulceration with subsequent blood loss. The blood loss manifested as melena (black stools), but was unapparent to the patient because of his sight impairment. The anemia became so profound (hemoglobin of 4) that he developed dyspnea and chest pain without having a significant degree of coronary atherosclerosis. Generation of a differential diagnosis The top diagnoses are prioritized in two ways: the most likely diagnoses and the most important ones (i.e., urgent or life threatening). The primary diagnosis (the one suspected most) is usually presented first, with support- ing evidence. However, occasionally, there is a diagnosis that is urgent and this should be presented first, even though it is less likely than the primary diagnosis. For example, consider a 40-year-old female with abdominal cramping and uterine bleeding. If the history and exam suggest the possi- bility of an ectopic pregnancy, this diagnosis should be listed first, even though the more likely diagnosis is uterine fibroadenomas. Frequently, there are still some discrepant details in the primary diagnosis. Early in the evaluation of a patient, there may be missing data, and the case cannot be made convincingly for the primary diagnosis. Then, other diagnoses should be discussed systematically, as alternative diagnoses. A seasoned clinician will be able to generate a primary diagnosis quickly, but, as discussed below, cognitive bias may adversely impact the consid- eration of other diagnoses. It is usually best to consider at least three diagnoses. A good habit is to consider diagnoses broadly enough to include at least three organs or categories of disease.'),\n",

Physical exam is significant for a temperature of 99.0 *F, otherwise unremarkable vital signs, and rales in the upper left posterior lung field. He has a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Differential diagnosis Infection This is most consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. In support of this diagnosis (a) the patient has an uncle who had tuberculosis, and (b) the timing of exposure is most consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, problems with this diagnosis include the following: until 3 months ago, he was healthy without known immunocompromise, and tuberculosis is unusual without an underlying debilitated state. Alternatively, the presentation could be explained by fungal pneumonia, for example, with histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, or coccidioidomycosis. However, he has not been in areas endemic for these organisms and, again, he is not known to be immunocompromised. Malignancy Primary pulmonary malignancy is another possibility. In support of this diagnosis, the patient has constitutional symptoms, including weight loss. However, problems with this diagnosis are that he has been a nonsmoker all his life and has no other known risk factors for primary lung carcinoma. The isolated left upper lobe infiltrate is less likely to be metastatic malignancy, although an obstructive endobronchial lesion with pneumonia as a consequence is still a possibility. Vasculitis Other less common possibilities include granulomatous anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis (Wegener's). In support of this diagnosis, the patient has constitutional symptoms and a history of recurrent sinus infections.

It is a dynamic process. It is important to realize that the techniques described above, including pattern recogni- tion, \"gestalt,\" and template matching, are critical to the efficient function of busy clinicians and are developed over time. These methods can be regarded as a diagnostic snapshot of what is happening at a particular point in time. However, the patient\\'s illness is a dynamic process that changes with time. Changes in the patient\\'s status and new laboratory and imaging data provide more information that needs to be accounted for in the evolving diagnosis and care process. Diagnosis reflects the clinician\\'s knowledge, clinical acumen, and problem- solving skills. In everyday practice, clinicians use expert skills to arrive at a diagnosis, often taking advantage of various mental shortcuts known as heuristics. Although the final \"working diagnosis\" (usually the primary diagnosis) expedites the management plan, it is a temporary diagnosis with much missing data. The heuristics described above, such as the \"string-along\" method and \"gestalt,\" also lend themselves to cognitive errors, i.e., failures of percep- tion and cognitive bias. Interestingly, cognitive errors are only rarely due to lack of medical knowledge. Graber et al. studied 100 cases of diagnostic error identified through autopsy discrepancies, quality assurance activities, and voluntary reports.1 They found that the underlying contributions to error fell into three natural categories: \"no fault\" (no identified process), system related (related to health system–based processes), and cognitive. In their study, the most common cognitive errors involved defective synthesis. Prema- ture closure, i.e., the failure to continue considering reasonable alterna- tives after a primary diagnosis is reached, was the single most common cause. This highlights the importance of recognizing that diagnosis is a dynamic process. One example given in the study was a wrong diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain after a motor vehicle accident; a ruptured spleen was eventually found. Other common causes of cognitive error in Graber et al.\\'s study included faulty context generation, misjudging the salience of findings, faulty perception, and errors arising from the use of heuristics. Overall, inadequate knowledge was least common. Faulty context generation, or failure to consider aspects of the pa- tient\\'s situation that are relevant to the diagnosis, can be devastating. 1 Graber ML, Franklin N, Gordon R (2005).

She was sent home with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, mild anemia was missed at initial diagnosis, and the patient died at home 2 days later from a perforated gastric ulcer. Patient encounters with initial care providers in internal medicine, family practice, and emergency medicine have the greatest likelihood of diagnostic uncertainty and the greatest possibility of delayed or missed diagnoses. However, all specialties are vulnerable to cognitive erro r. This was discovered in findings from several benchmark studies of medical error.2–4 An important example of cognitive error is anchoring bias , the ten- dency to lock onto salient features in the patient's initial presentation too early in the diagnostic process, then failing to adjust the initial impression in light of later information. This cognitive error can be made worse by confirmation bias , the tendency to look for confirming evidence to sup- port the working diagnosis rather than looking for evidence to refute it, despite the latter being more persuasive and definitive. Another common type of cognitive bias is gender bias , the tendency to believe that gender is a determining factor in the probability of diagnosis or a particular disease when no such predisposition basis exists. Gen erally, this results in overdiagnosis in the favored gender and underdiagnosis of the neglected gender.5 Understanding that we are all susceptible to cognitive errors, it is important to consider and record more than one diagnosis from the very beginning of the patient encounter. We suggest an organized data proc- essing of the accumulated information, and documentation of not only the features of the history and physical that support the primary and secondary diagnoses but also the features that refute them. It is probably wise to consider at least three diagnoses, preferably involving more than one organ system. For example, if a 37-year-old woman presents with irregular, heavy, vaginal bleeding, three organs or systems that might be considered include 1) uterine, 2) hematological (low platelets), and 3) endocrine (thyroid disease). 2 Brennan TA, Leape LL, Laird NM, et al.

Information processing is an important goal of the physician– patient interaction. It proceeds in three phases: data processing, hypothesis generation, and, finally, generation of a differential diagnosis. Data processing is a simple process of collecting all the \"findings\" and then trying to fit those findings together to make a more accurate hypothesis. Data processing is not only critical to the development of a diagnosis but also helps the development of a problem list. Hypothesis generation requires the use of multiple methods of aggre- gating information. These include pattern recognition techniques, such as \"string-along\" methods and \"gestalt.\" Generation of a diagnosis is a dynamic process that depends on pattern recognition and experience. The primary diagnosis (the one most suspected or most life threatening) is presented first, with supporting evidence. Other diagnoses should be routinely considered and discussed systematically as alternative diagnoses. Clinicians use a complex method of clinical decision-making that includes medical knowledge, experience, assumptions, and traditions as hypothesis-generating shortcuts. These shortcuts allow for efficient information management in a time-limited encounter; however, they may lend themselves to diagnostic error. Diagnostic errors occur, even with experienced clinicians. Therefore, broad differentials can mitigate some of these cognitive biases that may lead to medical errors.'),\n",

Many of these are subconscious and p oorly under- stood, for example, pattern recognition. There is also a tradition in medicine of discussing and justifying diagn o- ses openly. This happens during conferences on morbidity and mortality and on management, for example, the clinicopathological conferences (CPCs) at the Massachusetts General Hospital, which have been pub- lished for many years in the New England Journal of Medicine . Eddy and Clanton studied the thought processes of doctors when they were analyzing symptoms, signs, and test results at these CPCs. The authors concluded that they were searching for single items or aggre- gates of information that were associated with as small a number of differential diagnoses as possible. Any diagnosis chosen from this list became a \"hypothesis.\" Eddy and Clanton referred to these hypothesis- generating items as \"pivots.\"1 They were called \"diagnostic leads\" in articles describing the mathematical basis of this reasoning process,2,3,4,5 and this is what they are called in this book, which is based on the detailed understanding described in these studies. If such a lead was only associated with one diagnosis, then it would be \"pathognomonic\" (i.e., a necessary condition for that diagnosis) and, thus, a part of the definition of the diagnosis. In the absence of definitive diagnostic evidence, the pivot, or diagnostic lead, is used to suggest a differential diagnosis and to generate hypotheses. Eddy and Clanton described how experienced diagnosticians looked for further information to try to \"prune\" (or rule out) some of these hypo- thetical possibilities until only one was confirmed. If the remaining d iagnosis was confirmed by the combination of pivot and pruner, then the items of information used to do this would be sufficient diagnostic criteria an d thus form a part of the diagnostic definition. Such reasoning with definitive information can be represented easily with algorithms.

              "   'TRANSPARENT DIAGNOSIS 1 17 The problem is that students and inexperienced doctors may not have the knowledge to identify diagnostic leads and to chase up a diagnostic possibility by ruling out its rivals or showing that they are improbable. These combinations are sometimes recognized without assembling them logically when they are referred to as \"key clues,\" \"clusters,\" or \"syn- dromes\" that are pathognomonic or have short differential diagnoses. This handbook provides its readers with this information to allow them to recognize the best diagnostic leads and to follow them by generating diagnostic hypotheses. Each page heading represents a diagnostic lead, and the page contains its differential diagnoses. Alongside each of these diagnoses are the clinical findings that suggest that the diagnosis is prob- able, and the findings that confirm it by ruling out its rival diagnoses from the group of patients with that combination. It is important to understand why the information needed to suggest or confirm diagnoses is usually small. Many templates of disease have much in common; e.g., many of the symptoms and physical signs of pneumonia, pulmonary embolus, and heart failure are the same. It is the differences that allow the diagnostician to differentiate between them. These differences are described in the pages of this book as findings that suggest or confirm diagnoses. Negative findings are also important in this role of suggesting or confirming diagnoses (but negative findings are not helpful as diagnostic leads, because people with most other diseases and those who are healthy also have them). The descriptions alongside each diagnosis on a page are often brief because the differences between diagnoses may be few. This is why the diagnostic process may be difficult for the novice to master quickly but look simple in the hands of the expert, who knows what to focus on. Unlike textbooks that concentrate on describing diseases processes, often in vivid and elegant detail, this book focuses on findings that are useful during the diagnostic process, to speed up the reader\\'s acquisition of diagnostic skills. The reader is encouraged to add to this information or modify it. However, little if any evidence has been collected yet to substantiate the performance of leads and differentiators. How to use this book The book can be used in two ways. 1. You may browse its pages and try to guess from your knowledge of anatomy or physiology the possible diagnoses linked to it. You should keep covering the column of diagnoses and test to see whether you can guess each diagnosis by reading the findings that suggest or confirm it. By doing this, you will begin to acquire the type of knowledge used by experienced doctors at the CPCs. 2. The book can also be used when solving diagnostic problems. Write down your differential diagnoses and put in brackets after each diagnosis the positive and negative findings that you think support each diagnosis. Look up the patient\\'s positive findings in this book: they will be repre- sented by page headings. If you see a diagnosis on the page that you have not considered, consider it. As you view the differential diagnoses you have considered, look at the suggesting and confirming findings to see if you have already looked for them; if not, do so.'),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 18 The diagnostic lead Unless a finding happens to be a pathognomonic diagnostic criterion that already confirms a diagnosis, it will be associated with more than one diagnosis. It will therefore have to be interpreted in combination with other findings before a single diagnosis becomes more probable or can be confirmed. These combinations may be recognized immediately as highly predictive clusters or syndromes. If not, the combination may have to be assembled logically by using one of the component findings as a \"lead\" and using the others to make up a combination that identifies a group of patients within which all but one diagnosis is improbable or eliminated. Each page in Chapters 3–18 of this book is based on the conce pt of a lead that is predictive of a list of differential diagnoses. The suggesting findings on each page can be used to make a diagnosis more probable; the confirming findings will make that diagnosis certain. The principle of using logic to assemble patterns or syndromes is as follows. If a 24-year-old man presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and is accompanied by guarding, then this cluster of findings suggests appendicitis. This working diagnosis might be confirmed during a laparotomy by seeing the definitive finding of a red, swollen appendix and treated with appendectomy with resolution of the pain so that the diagnosis becomes final. Logic based on proportions The same combination of findings can also be assembled logically because RLQ pain would be a good short lead due to appendicitis (e.g., in 40/100 of hypothetical patients with the lead), nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP) (e.g., in 60/100). Guarding occurs commonly in appendicitis but rarely in those with NSAP, which means that the probable diagnosis is appendicitis. Note that NSAP is an example of a group of very important diagnoses. These are self-limiting conditions that resolve spontaneously before any treatment other than relief of symptoms is required. These nonspecific (NS) diagnoses (e.g., NS headache, NS chest pain) are the most common diagnoses in medicine. They are confirmed by careful follow-up but typi- cally present with a small number of symptoms and signs that are mild and of recent onset. Learning to deal with these safely using appropriate follow-up is one of the most important diagnostic skills to be acquired. Diagnostic logic using proportions is helped by choosing a lead with a small number of diagnostic possibilities that account for a high propor- tion of patients (e.g., over 95%-ideally 100% as in the above example). Another important principle is that the low frequency of a single find- ing gives an upper limit for the frequency of occurrence of a combination that includes that finding. Thus, if guarding occurs in 5% x 60 = 3 of those with NSAP, then guarding with RLQ pain must occur in 3 patients or fewer (as the presence or absence of RLQ pain will further subdivide the group of 3 who have guarding). Care must be taken with the rest of the logic, however. If guarding occurs in 50% and RLQ pain also occurs in 50% of those with appendicitis, it is possible that each finding occurs in different halves of the group w ith'),\n",

Under these circumstances, it would be wrong to assume that most patients with RLQ pain and guarding had appendicitis. However, if guarding occurred in 95% and RLQ pain occurred in 85% of those with appendicitis, then even if they occur together as infrequently as possibl e (i.e., there was maximum negative statistical dependency), both have to occur in at least 80% (i.e., 0.95 + 0.85 – 1 = 0.80). In terms of patient numbers, this would be at least 80% x 40 = 32 of the original 100 patients. Therefore, appendicitis must occur in at least 32/(32+3) = 91% of those with RLQ pain and guarding. Assumptions and estimates It is commonly assumed that findings such as guarding and RLQ pain occur together by chance in conditions such as appendicitis. This can be used to give an estimate of the likelihood of discovering a combination of findings in patients who have a diagnostic criterion. Thus the likelihood of getting the combination of RLQ pain with guarding in those with appen- dicitis would be assumed to be 95% x 85% = 80.75%. This is called the statistical independence assumption. However, if RLQ pain and guarding were assumed to occur as often as possible in the same patients with appendicitis (i.e., there was positive statistical dependency), then the combination would occur in 85% of those with appendicitis. Central evidence Once a diagnostic criterion is discovered (e.g., a red, swollen appendix), as this does not occur in the other conditions by definition, it rules them out completely. The probability of the diagnosis (e.g., of appendicitis) then becomes 100%, irrespective of the nature of the preceding findings. Thus, many findings discovered in the early part of the diagnostic proc- ess are often not mentioned when better evidence becomes available later (even if the better evidence does not give 100% certainty). Better evidence is often assumed to give a good estimate of the probability for the total evidence. This small combination of powerful evidence is often called the \"relevant\" or \"central\" evidence. However, the patient\\'s original presenting complaint is always relevant because, unless it resolves, th e diagnosis does not become final. An alternative or additional diagnosis may have to be considered to explain the patient\\'s findings. Evidence-based differential diagnosis In practice, this reasoning process is done informally and little thought is given to the underlying rigorous, logical principles, frequencies, or simplify- ing assumptions. However, if we wish to practice evidence-based medicine and evidence-based diagnosis, it is important that careful thought be given to the underlying logical principles of diagnosis. It will be necessary to collect data on the frequency in diagnostic leads or pivots of various diagnoses. This will include clinical findings and te st results (including numerical test results) in different clinical settings. It will also be important to determine the frequencies of symptoms, signs, and distributions of numerical test results in patients with various differential diagnoses and in patients with diagnoses of different degrees of severity.'),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 20 Differential diagnosis and diagnostic screening The arithmetic used to represent the screening of populations for diagnoses is different from the arithmetic of differential diagnosis. It might be helpful to an epidemiologist to know the proportion of times a particular diagnosis will be confirmed in due course after the positive screening test has been investigated to determine its cause. One can measure this proportion directly in a study-e.g., of 12 patients who are dipstick positive for micro- albumin, 8 turn out eventually to have incipient nephropathy. However, instead of measuring the proportion of 8/12 directly, this frequency of 8/12 = 0.75 is usually calculated by epidemiologists and statisticians indirectly by applying Bayes theorem to 1) an estimate of the prevalence or incidence of the diagnosis, 2) the prevalence or incidence of the screening test result in the population to be studied, and 3) an estimate of the frequency of the test result in those confirmed to have the diagnosis. Screening in the diagnostic setting It is not only epidemiologists who perform screening tests. These tests are also performed by primary care physicians and specialists who look after populations of patients who are asympt omatic but who have a high risk of developing some condition, e.g., diabetic nephropathy. If such a patient is asked open questions, e.g., \"Do you have any symptoms that you wish to tell me about?\" severe symptoms may be remembered but minor ones may be forgotten. If the patient is asked closed questions, e.g., \"Does your urine froth sometimes?\" then fewer symptoms may be missed but spurious posi- tive responses may be given, perhaps to agree with the doctor. Similarly, if a detection process is made more biochemically sensitive, e.g., by calling a smaller color change on the urine dipstick paper positive, then it may result in more spurious false-positive results. However, if the process is modified by calling only a larger color test change on the urine dipstick positive, it may be less biochemically (and statistically) sensitive. If a sensitive screening test is negative, the patient is usually reassured that no further tests are necessary. However, if, for example, a preliminary urine test for microalbuminuria is positive, then the confirmatory tests of three 24-hour urine collections together with urine microscopy and culture may have to be done to see if early diabetic nephropathy is present. Waiting rooms and Venn diagrams The accompanying Venn diagram (Fig. 2.1) represents 20 diabetic patients in a waiting room, of whom 9 are known to have incipient nephropathy. Twelve patients have a positive dipstick test. There are 8 patients with incipient nephropathy who are dipstick positive; these are enclosed in the overlapping circles. There are 7 patients who have no incipient neph- ropathy and are dipstick negative, and they fall outside both circles. There are 4 patients who are dipstick positive with no incipient neph- ropathy and a single patient who is dipstick negative with nephropathy. These numbers are also represented in the usual 2 x 2 table (see Table 2.1), which also show the totals with and without incipient nephropathy and those who are dipstick positive and dipstick negative.'),\n",

In the above example, the sensitivity was 8/9 and is shown near the top of the probability map (Fig. 2.2). This probability map shows the relationship between the 8 logical propositions that can be based on a Venn diagram. Read the line representing sensitivity from right to left as follows: if there is incipient nephropathy, then 8/9 are dipstick positive. The obverse of this is the false-negative rate: if there is nephropathy, then 1/9 are dipstick negative. The converse to the sensitivity is the posi- tive predictive value, which is read from left to right as follows: if the dipstick is positive, then 8/12 have nephropathy. The negative predictive value is at the bottom of the map and may be read as follows: if the dipstick is negative, then 7/8 have no nephropathy. The converse is read in the reverse direction and is called the \"specifi city\": if there is no nephropathy, then 7/11 are dipstick negative. Finally, the obverse of the specificity is the false positive rate: if there is no nephropathy then 4/11 are dipstick positive.

              "   'CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 22 Effect of clinical setting on diagnostic probabilities The nature of the clinical setting can affect the predictive probabilities of the differential diagnoses of diagnostic leads. The group discussed previ- ously was patients in a diabetic follow-up clinic waiting room. The data might be different in another setting such as a primary care waiting room for asymptomatic patients having annual checkups or an antenatal clinic. For example, if another waiting room contained many new diabetic patients, the prevalence of incipient nephropathy might be lower (e.g., 4/20) because the nephropathy in newly diagnosed diabetics was at an earlier stage, so that fewer would test positive with a dipstick (e.g., the sensitivity might be 2/4). If the incidence of a newly dipstick- positive result was 8/20, the positive predictive value in this new setting would be less at 2/8: 4/20 x 2/4 ÷ 8/20 = 2/8 Probability map Dipstick positive Dipstick negativeIncipient nephropathy No incipient nephropathy8/98/12 9/20 12/20 11/208/20 4/121/91/84/11 7/11 7/8SensitivityPositive Predictive value Specificity Negative predictive valueStudy population False negative rateFalse positive rate Figure 2.2 Probability map. Diagnostic leads again If the predictive value of a positive dipstick was 2/8, this begs the ques- tion: what was producing the positive result in the other 6/8, or 75%, of patients? In this new clinic we might find that 2/8 had a urinary tract infection and 4/8 had had nonspecific microalbuminuria (which means that when another urine specimen was taken, the test was negative). This might mean that new patients were less expert at producing an uncon- taminated specimen. In the diabetic follow-up clinic, the positive predictive value was 8/12, so that only 4/12 = 33.3% had some other diagnosis, e.g., 3/12 had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and only 1/12 of these patients had nonspe- cific microalbuminuria.'),\n",

              "   'EFFECT OF CLINICAL SETTING ON DIAGNOSTIC PROBABILITIES 1 23 What is important here is that the differential diagnosis of a positive dipstick is the same in both clinical settings, but the proportions of the three different diagnoses are different. However, the tests used to inves- tigate the finding in this situation are definitive, e.g., the urinalysis result is assumed to confirm or exclude a UTI. A negative urinalysis is also a necessary condition for diagnosing diabetic nephropathy, together with three 24-hour urine collections to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Repeating the dipstick test is assumed to confirm or exclude nonspecific microalbuminuria. In other words, building these test results into the definitions means that the probabilities of the diagnoses rise to 100% or drop to 0%. This result is not affected in this situation by the initial predictive value of a positive dipstick result in the different settings. This means that the infor- mation in this book can be used in any clinical setting, provided that confirmatory tests are used eventually. In the current absence of data on diagnostic leads and differentiators, the reader has to rely on common sense and experience to estimate the initial probabilities given by the lead and the provisional probabilities given by the suggesting findings of each differential diagnosis. Usefulness of findings in differential diagnoses 1. In order for a symptom, signs, or test result to be useful as a diagnostic lead, as small a number of differential diagnoses as possible should account for as high a proportion of patients as possible (e.g., 95% but ideally 100%) of patients with that finding. 2. In order for a finding to be a strong differentiator between the postulated diagnosis associated with a diagnostic lead and the rival possibilities, it must occur as often as possible in the postulated diagnosis being chased and as rarely as possible (ideally never) in at least one of the rival differential diagnoses. It should be noted that (2) refers to the ratio of two sensitivities and not the likelihood ratio, which is the sensitivity divided by the false-positive rate (the false-positive rate being 1-the specificity). The mathematical basis of this is described elsewhere.1,2,3,4 Research needs to be done to establish which test results provide powerful diagnostic leads and differentiators. Where such tests are lacki ng, new ones can be designed on the basis of scientific understanding of disease processes and therapeutics. 1 Llewelyn DEH (1975).

              "   'CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 24 \"Gold-standard\" diagnostic criteria: are they valid? Pay careful attention to the patient\\'s diagnosis when considering if a treatment is expected to be of benefit. It does not matter how powerful a treatment might be; it will not work if it is given to the wrong patients and may indeed do more harm than good by causing adverse effe cts with no prospect of benefit. The role of a physician is to decide which patients will benefit from a specific treatment or advice, and this is done by arriving at a diagnosis. For this reason, the explanation given for a treatment is bound up with the diagnosis. This applies to the explanation for how the treatment changes the imagined underlying process and to the pragmatic result of a clinical trial comparing the response to treatment with that of something else. So, a perfectly valid diagnostic criterion will help to identify all those and only those patients who will respond to a treatment. If only a proportion of patients respond to a treatment, then it is better to subdivide the diagnosis to identify those who do and those who do not respond. For example, only a proportion of patients suffering from a myocardial infarction (MI) benefit from thrombolysis or angioplasty. However, more patients with ST elevation do so. The diagnosis of MI has thus been subdivided into ST-elevation MI with a high response rate to thrombolysis or angioplasty, and non-ST-elevation MI, which identifies those who are not very responsive and thus not offered these treatments. The ability of a diagnostic criterion to predict treatment response is known as its validity . The most valid test result for an evolving MI would be the one that identified all those, and only those, who responded to thrombolysis or angioplasty. Note that MI now envelops other diag nos- tic groups or sets. This is the case for many diagnoses, diabe tes mellitus being an important example. One of the diagnoses it envelops is incipient diabetic nephropathy. If a gold-standard test (i.e., diagnostic criterion) is based on a meas- urement, another factor that needs determining is the best cutoff point. For example, the upper limit of the normal range for the albumin excretion rate (AER) is 20 μg/min, based on samples taken from healthy laboratory volunteers. This cutoff point is also used to decide if a diabetic patient has incipient diabetic nephropathy by assuming that all those above this level are at significantly increased risk of nephropathy, e.g., within 2 years. However, if only a small proportion of patients with an initial rate between 20 and 40 μg/min develop nephropathy (as shown in Fig. 2.3), then nephropathy will be incipient for a very few only. If the risk of nephropathy rises rap idly above 40 μg/min, this might be a more suitable cutoff point for incipient diabetic nephropathy.1 1 Llewelyn DEH, Garcia-Puig J (2004).

              "   '\"GOLD-STANDARD\" DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: ARE THEY VALID? 1 25 Thus, empirical evidence should be sought for the validity of a diagnostic criterion, not for just choosing a cutoff point on theoretical grounds , e.g., 2 standard deviations above the logarithmic mean. The particular evidence regarding a particular patient\\'s diagnosis throughout this Handbook is presented as Suggested by and Confirmed by . Suggested by introduces features that make it probable that the diagnosis will be confirmed by another set of tests, which are thus worth doing. The confirming features usually indicate that some specific advice or treatment should be given. However, in urgent cases, treatment may begin sooner, when the danger of avoiding delay is greater than giving it prematurely and unnecessarily. In other cases, the result of treatment may be the only practical confirmatory test. So, if the treatment can be stopped when the initial response is not promising, this is referred to as a therapeutic gold-standard test. This is done sometimes in a double-blind crossover manner-the so-called N-of- 1 trial. The design is double-blind so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows what treatment is being taken until the trial of therapy is complete, when they both decide if the preliminary response is worth pursuing with continuous treatment. A perfectly valid diagnostic criterion would identify all those and only those with a presenting complaint who would respond to a particular treatment by their presenting complaint resolving, not returning, and leaving them with perfect health. The perfect treatment given to those with a perfect diagnostic criterion would cause no adverse effects and cause all those with a presenting complaint and diagnostic criterion to get better, who would not otherwise get better without that treatment. 0.00%10.00%20.00%30.00%40.00% 20–40 41–80 81–120 121–160 161–200 Initial urinary albumin excretion rate ( AER) (µg/min)Proportion developing nephropathy Figure 2.3 Proportion of patients developing diabetic nephropathy 2 years after initial albumin excretion rate (AER) value, as shown.'),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 26 Working diagnoses and final diagnoses Many patients have symptoms, physical signs, and tests results that do not satisfy diagnostic criteria. Some diagnostic criteria are not easily ac cessible; for example, they depend on histology or an appearance at major surgery . We may thus have to begin treatment when there are no recognized criteria. For example, most antibiotics are prescribed for a chest infection be- fore it is confirmed by culturing bacteria. However, when we decide to treat, we always assume that if a randomized, controlled trial were to be done on such a group of patients, more would benefit from treatment than from placebo (but we would think so with more confidence when there is a diagnostic criterion). If we are asked to explain why we chose that particular treatment, we could say that we imagine the presence of the disease process for the time being. This is called a \"working diagnosis.\" It is equivalent to a scientific hypothesis during an experiment. If the patient gets better in the ex- pected way and if there was no practical purpose for doing further tests, then we would then assume that we were correct. This would be called a \"final diagnosis.\" It would be the same as a hypothesis becoming a scientific theory because there is no immediate intention to do another experiment to test it. In both cases, we would be citing an imagined process, knowing that it was theoretical and not proven (i.e., by direct observation of everything being imagined). In the case of a treatment, we would not have been able to prove that the patient would not have gotten better anyway without the treatment. In order to prove this, we would have to do the impossi- ble by turning the clock back and not giving the treatment, to see what happens. It should also be remembered that even if diagnostic criteria are pre- sent, this does not guarantee a response to treatment. Diagnostic criteria are there for consistency between different doctors\\' diagnoses, and they also allow randomized trials to be done and the knowledge to be shared. Thus, if the diagnostic criteria were chosen carefully to be valid in terms of predicting outcome, then more patients would respond to treatment (and fewer to placebo in a clinical trial) when using the criterion than when not using it. If we stray away from such published clinical-trial criteria when giving treatments, then we have to accept that we are guessing treatment response by extrapolation, and not basing it on for- mal, documented experience in that clinical trial. If the patient failed to respond to the treatment that might lead to a final diagnosis, then we would carry out further tests to discover if there is evidence for some other diagnosis or to look for further evidence for the original diagnosis that simply did not respond to the treatment. This further evidence might be a successful response to some other treatment that could work for the original working diagnosis.'),\n",

              "   \"WORKING DIAGNOSES AND FINAL DIAGNOSES 1 27 The practical purpose of a diagnosis from the patient's point of view is to predict the outcomes of a distressing complaint, with or without treatment. Sophisticated technology is there to improve the validity of diagnostic criteria in terms of their ability to predict what will happen to the patient's symptoms. A diagnosis represents imagination that includes clinical findings and test results, so it can never be proven to be true in its entirety by a single test. The number of detailed imaginary models (e.g., at the molecular level) under the umbrella term of diagnosis is limited only by the human imagination. Science is concerned with imaginative theories or models that can be tested against observed facts, documented, and then shared with others. I f n o a s p e c t o f a t h e o r y c a n b e t e s t e d b y a n y f o r m o f o b s e r v a t i o n , i t cannot be the subject of scientific study. The process of imagining more models of disease (and discarding some of them because they do not fit the facts) results in scientific models becoming more detailed. One effect of this is that diagnoses may become subdivided, e.g., MI has become subdivided into ST-elevation MI respon- sive to thrombolysis or angioplasty, and non-ST-elevation MI, which is not. So a working or final diagnosis is simply the title to a model, hypothe- sis, or theory that explains and connects the combination of pre- treatment facts (e.g., chest pain with ST elevation) to an outcome of treatment with or without a treatment (e.g., lowering of raised ST segments after thrombolysis). In addition to this imaginative view of diagnosis, there is also the public, logical approach, which is the main subject of this book.\"),\n",

              "   \"CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 28 Dynamic diagnoses It is important to understand that clinical diagnosis is not a static classifi- cation system based on diagnostic criteria or their probable presence. It is a dynamic process. Diagnostic algorithms classify patients by following a logical pathway. This works bests when interpreting components of diagnostic criteria. Other systems use findings such as symptoms and physical signs to predict the probable presence of diagnostic criteria. All of these methods can be regarded as diagnosing a snapshot of wh at is happening at a particular time. However, the diagnostician will be tryi ng to imagine the presence of a dynamic process that changes with time. Thi s could be over seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years, and the response in terms of investigation and treatment has to be timed appropriately. There may be several processes taking place at the same time, some progressing over years (e.g., atheromatous changes), some over minutes to hours (e.g., a thrombosis in a coronary artery), some over minutes or seconds (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), and others instantaneously (e.g., a cardiac arrest). This means that a diagnostic process leading to treatment may have to happen repeatedly and for a number of diagnoses at the same time. It might be more appropriate to think of the process as one of feed- b a c k c o n t r o l .

After the initial history and examination, the feedback information may come from electronic monitoring, nursing observations, ward rounds, or hospital clinic or primary-care follow-up. The mechanisms of interest to the diagnostician are of three types. The first type is mechanisms that control the internal milieu by keeping tem- perature, tissue perfusion, blood gases, and biochemistry constant. The second type is those mechanisms that control the body's structure by effecting repair in response to any damage. The third type consists of those that control the external milieu of day-to-day living. These three types are all interdependent. If one mechanism fails, it may unmask other weaknesses by causing other failures. It may not be enough to treat the main failure. It is often necessary also to treat the causes a nd consequences, as they may be unable to recover on their own. For exam- ple, a coronary thrombosis may be treated with thrombolysis, but an y resulting rhythm abnormalities may need to be treated, as well as the causative risk factors (e.g., smoking) that could result in recurrence . So when we explain our diagnostic thought processes, it helps to think of each diagnosis as a subheading with its own evidence and decision. The process of taking a history and examining a new patient may take about an hour. If the patient is acutely ill, there may have to be an urgent, life-saving diagnosis and treatment with a reassessment every few min- utes until the patient is stable. The presenting complaint and a quick examination may also suggest a minor complaint such as a viral sore throat that is best managed by simple measures and by having the patient return in a few days.\"),\n",

The management may involve tests, treatments, and their results, which produce further evidence, a revised diagnosis, and further management. The probability of any diagnosis being confirmed with diagnostic criteria or becoming the final diagnosis by responding to treatment may not be very high initially. However, you can reassure the patient that the follow-up process will allow further attempts to take place until you get it right. In many cases the problem will resolve spontaneously before you can arrive at any diagnosis that suggests a treatment. In other cases you may have to observe the patient closely as the mystery disease progresses so that new evidence becomes available. In this way, uncertainty may be overcome by cycles of follow-up and review.'),\n",

              "   \"CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 30 Transparency and replication Physicians work closely with patients, relatives, other physicians, and members of other disciplines. They frequently hand over care to others who have to understand what is happening, and if they agree, to continue with the plan. There is little place in all of this for mystery and obscurity, which may arouse suspicion about the doctor's motives or competence. An experienced doctor would know quickly if the evidence did not add up. He or she would check with the patient to see if the presenting complaint is accurate and to check if the evidence given justifies accepting the main diagnosis. It is also easy to see if all the necessary treatments have been given. The same can be done for all the other diagnoses. If there is doubt about the diagnoses because there is insufficient evi- dence, then other diagnoses may also have to be considered and added to the list. One reason for such doubt would be if the patient still has symptoms that are slow to resolve. If there is doubt as to whether the answers are sensible, then the history and examination has to be repeated. If the sam e findings are discovered ag ain, then they can be s aid to have been corroborated or replicated. Evidence is of two types. The first type is the particular evidence displayed in that particular situation for a particular patient. It has to be given with a time and place and in enough detail to allow a listener to question the witness or to repeat the observations so that they can be replicated along with the reasoning process and decision. (The same principles are used in the legal profession.) The second part of the evidence is experience from many similar past situations and their outcomes, which demonstrated that a high propor- tion were successful. This is general evidence, in contrast to the particular evidence. For a treatment, it would consist of what happened in a cli nical trial to some patients on the treatment and to others on a placebo or something else. The problem is that such general or scientific ev idence is not available for much of what we do in medicine, especially when using different diagnostic criteria or gold-standard tests. General scientific evidence is based on observations made on grou ps of individuals (who each have their own particular observations). If a listener is going to accept such observations as general scientific evi- dence, the results and methods have to be described in sufficient detail to be repeated by someone else and thus for the study result to be replicated, if necessary. If the study and its description is of high quality and published in a reputable journal (which reflects the quality), then the reader may not feel obliged to repeat it. One criterion is that there was a sensible hypothesis and thus a good reason for doing the study (i.e., that it was not just a chance observation). Another important criterion would be that the numbers of observations made were high, so that the statistical probability of replicating the study result was high (e.g., there was a 95% chance of getting a repeat result between two clinically acceptable confidence limits).\"),\n",

              "   'TRANSPARENCY AND REPLICATION 1 31 Modern medicine involves careful evidence-gathering and the use of imagination to decide on the best action. These actions are then explaine d to others with diagnoses and evidence for those diagnoses. There is thus a private, imaginative stage and then a public, transparent stage to allow others to decide if they can agree. If it is not possible to provide a clear rationale in a way that can be understood by others who will be affected by an action, then the wisdom of the action should be reconsidered. One way of providing such a transparent rationale is to set out a diag- nostic opinion in writing with clear, particular evidence in support o f each diagnosis, for others to discuss (see Box 2.1). This format for supporting a diagnosis with evidence that suggests or confirms the diagnosis is used throughout this book.

              "   \"CHAPTER 2 Transparent diagnosis 32 Differences of opinion about a diagnosis Differences of opinion can sometimes cause consternation; a common reaction is that someone has to be wrong. Different opinions can all be valid if they are based on documented experience and framed as prob- ability statements with a sensible element of doubt. For example, if a physician makes a number of different predictions with 50% certainty and 50% turn out to be correct overall, this shows good overall judgment. Different members of the team can thus hold different valid opinions about a diagnosis for a particular patient on the basis of their different personal experiences. A doctor may be wrong about a prediction for a particular patient and yet be correct 75% of the time for such predic tions with a 75% probability when they are all taken together in the long run. However, if a single opinion has to be adopted by a team to decide what should be done for a particular patient, then traditionally the opin- ion of the most senior member present is adopted (usually after this person has listened carefully to others). If an opinion is totally certain, then it implies that all other opinions must be wrong. An opinion held with certainty also raises questions about the holder's judgment because, in the long run, it is unlikely that 100% of predictions will be correct. An opinion may become distorted consciously or subconsciously because the holder stands to gain person- ally from its implementation. It is therefore important to be able to reas- sure patients and team members if there are differences of opinion. It is also important not to confuse opinions about outcomes with rules that a team has agreed to abide by. A team member may point out that a rule should be followed; this is not an overconfident opinion but a fact, if it was agreed at a particular time and place. Overconfidence is also dif- ferent from decisiveness. One can be decisive by choosing an option with a low probability of success because it represents the best of a number of poor options. Differences of opinion may occur because the particular facts on which they are based are different. The first thing to do when there is a differ- ence of opinion, therefore, is to check the particular facts for the patient and, if necessary, review the methods and conventions used by the team to get agreement. This process may allow facts to be replicated (see Transparency and Replication, p. 30). The second thing to do is to clarify the personal and published experi- ence on which the opinion and probability are based. This would include the facts that identified the group of patients who were followed and the details of outcomes, such as the diagnostic criteria used or the treatment results. Clarification of the facts often leads to agreement by revealing over- sights and misunderstandings or pooling of experience. Meta-analysis is a technique for combining data from different publications. Bayesian statis- ticians also combine documented data with personal, undocumented, subjective experience. Decision analysis can be used to ask patients' opinions of how they would feel about different outcomes, so that this can be taken into account when interpreting the meta-analyses and the personal experiences of doctors.\"),\n",

There are also particular schools of thought, and these are often represented by local guidelines (e.g., which antibiotic should be used as first-line treatment). If teams agree to abide by such guidelines, then differences of opinion are minimized and teamwork is made easier. Clinical audit is designed to detect poor performance that might be due to poor choice of guidelines for diagnosis or for treatment.

Diagnosis is derived from the Greek \"to see through\" (i.e., the history, physical examination, special investiga tions, and response to treatment). The diagnosis must not imply that there is only some single hidden process that needs to be discovered. The diagnosis (or diagnostic formula- tion) may have to include various causes, consequences, interactions, and other independent processes. As well as internal medical processes, it has to include external factors such as circumstances at home and the effects on self-care, employment, and leisure. Clearly, the most informative part of this broad diagnostic process will be the history. The history also enables patients and supporters to iden- tify the issues that they want addressed in terms of discomfort, loss of function, and difficulties with day-to-day existence. Gold standards for final diagnoses are best based on the outcome of patients\\' symptoms combined with the result of histology, biochemistry, or some other measurements. So, final diagnoses are often based on initial history-taking skills from which outcomes can be assessed. Observe normal social conventions. Introduce yourself politely and invite the patient and any accompanying persons to do the same. Check details such as the patient\\'s date of birth, address, etc. It is then important to establish very clearly why the patient has sought help. This is known as the chief (or presenting) complaint. Ask the patient about its severity and duration and always record this. Be prepared to act immediately to give symptomatic relief (e.g., for pain) if the patient is distressed. In some cases, the chief complaint may not explain the decision to seek help. The patient may be too ill, shy, guilty, or embarrassed to describe what is happening accurately. In other cases, it may be someone else who is unduly worried (e.g., the wife of a lethargic husband, parents of a child or caregivers of an elderly person who can no longer cope). Be alert and explore the real reason if there is doubt. Having established the chief complaint(s), establish the factual details of place and time. It is the ability to give a place and time that establishes the complaints as facts. (Medicine shares this convention with pure sci ence and law.) Listen to what the patient says without prompting first, but, if neces- sary, ask where they were and what they were doing when the problem was first noticed. This will help the patient to recall what happened and also stimulate your own diagnostic imagination. Establish the speed of initial onset and subsequent change in severity with time. This helps you to imagine the kind of pathological process that is taking place. An onset within seconds suggests a fit or heart rhythm abnormality; over minutes, a bleed or clotting process; hours to days, an acute infection; days to weeks, a chronic infection; weeks to months, a tumor; and months to years, a degenerative process.'),\n",

If there are other complaints, note the same details (the time courses of other new symptoms are often the same, however). Ask about other associated, aggravating, and relieving factors, especially as a result of the patient's own actions and those of others. Ask what the patient thinks is going on. You will have to continue with cycles of evidence, diagnosis, action, more evidence, revised diagnoses, further action, etc. Establish not only what the patient's complaints are and document them, but also the patient's own fears and actions. This will be the starting point for your own explanation and suggestions to the patient later about what is to be done.

It was relieved that day by warm drinks and acetaminophen, but when she woke the following morning it was very severe. It was no longer relieved by acetaminophen (she found swallowing very painful) and she was too unwell to get up. There had been no previous sore throats. She thought that her neck was getting stiff. Her friend had died of menin- gococcal meningitis a few years previously and this worried her. She called her PCP and was seen at the clinic that day. The doctor was concerned that she lived alone and looked very unwell and had her admitted to the hospital. The most striking symptom in this case is the severe sore throat that is getting worse. This is an example of a feature with a short list of causes-a good lead. Most readers will have experienced a sore throat and be aware that it is usually due to a viral pharyngitis, tonsillitis (due to a hemolytic streptococcus), glandular fever, or something else in a rela- tively small proportion of cases (see p. 100). Very rarely, these causes include the beginning of a meningococcal infection. This loomed large in the patient's mind because of the fate of her friend. The history is com- patible with all of these possibilities. If a better lead with an even shorter differential diagnosis turns up later, you may use that. Use the other findings to try to confirm one cause of the shortest lead (and thus eliminate the others). Consider if the remaining abnormal findings could resolve if the confirmed diagnosis were treated. If not, look for another coexisting diagnosis. This handbook contains a selection of findings with short differential diagnoses. Single and small combinations of findings of this kind form the foundation of the process of arriving at a working diagnosis (i.e., until the diagnosis is final and no further tests or treatment changes are contem- plated). With growing experience, you will learn to recognize more combinations that usually point to a single or a few diagnoses and have to resort less often to working through the possibilities in a conscious way, using the concepts described in this book. However, you will continue to be faced with new or strange situations throughout your career; this is what makes medical practice such a chal- lenge. The approaches you develop early in your career to deal with new situations will stand you in good stead for the remainder of your career. The next step is the past medical history (PMH).\"),\n",

Taking carbimazole, 5 mg daily. The past medical history (PMH) in this case has three components: the diagnosis, the evidence, and the management. Thyrotoxicosis is the diag- nosis, which summarizes what is imagined to have happened. Anxiety, weight loss, and abnormal thyroid function tests summarize the evidence for imaging what had happened. The management was taking carbima- zole, 5 mg daily. In many cases, the patient would not be able to provide these details and they would have to be extracted from the hospital or primary care records, in which case it is helpful to name the hospital (the fictitious Osler Hospital, in this case) or primary care center or doctor responsible. It is important to note, however, that a comprehensive PMH in this format can be written immediately after any consultation-in the hospital or primary care center-with results and dates. It can be included with any communication so that the recipient does not have to hunt for the details. It is very helpful for those that follow the initial consultation (and this may include you). From time to time in the hand-written follow-up notes you may wish to take stock and write down a current PMH that sets out the numbered list of diagnoses, with the evidence and management in parentheses. In this case, the past history also raises the possibility of recurrence o f thyroid disease causing the sore throat, but the only thyroid condition that would do this is acute thyroiditis (viral or autoimmune). This is a rare condition and is not included in lists of common causes of a sore thro at. The message to be taken away from this example is that if the patient has had a condition in the PMH, possible links should be recalled or looked up to see if any of these could explain the presenting problem. In this sense, a history of chronic or recurrent conditions can be used as a lead. So, any type of lead with a short list of possible associations should be considered.'),\n",

How- ever, if the patient is on medication, then it indicates that there is an active medical condition, not just a past medical history. Therefore, there is something to be said for documenting the drug history immediately after the past medical history so that past and current conditions can be considered together.

This is good practice (not often followed). The evidence for thyrotoxicosis has been given already in the past medical history. Recreational drugs have also been covered in this drug history, but they are often included with the social history. If you look up the side effects of carbimazole, you will see that they include agranulocytosis, which could explain the sore throat. If this was known when the HPI was being written out, it could be included as a possible causal factor in the HPI.

Much of the physical examination is directed at looking for information to help to confirm or exclude the diagnostic possibilities raised by the history. It is therefore worth pausing at the end of the history to think about the diagnostic possibilities so far. In some professional examinations, the candidate is asked only to take a history and to give diagnostic conclusions and a management plan of investigations and treatment options. Following is a reasonable differential for the main diagnosis: - ? Viral pharyngitis (\"?\" means a reasonable probability, e.g., 20%–80%) - ? Glandular fever - ? Acute follicular tonsillitis - ? Agranulocytosis due to carbimazole - ?? Meningococcal meningitis (\"??\" means a low probability, e.g., <20%) Other diagnoses might be - Inadequate domestic support currently for acute illness - ?? Undiscovered type 2 diabetes mellitus The part of the physical examination to concentrate on would be the appearance of the pharynx and tonsils to see if the latter resembled strawberries and cream, suggestive of acute follicular tonsillitis, or simple redness with no pus, suggestive of a pharyngitis possibly of viral origin. Look for enlarged lymph nodes in the neck to support a brisk response to infection, and neck stiffness that would support meningitis. The special investigations would include an urgent white cell count (WBC) to see if there were absent or low white cells, confirming agranu- locytosis; raised neutrophil white cells, suggesting bacterial infection; or raised lymphocytes, suggesting viral infection. Urine should be tested for sugar and a fasting blood sugar test done. The immediate treatment options would be to continue the acetamino- phen for pain relief and offer additional analgesia such as codeine phosp hate.

Although there are benefits to taking a systematic approach, especially if you are a student or doctor faced with an unfamiliar problem, consulta- tions may have to be very rapid with shortcuts. The circumstances may disrupt any attempt to be systematic, for example, when examining a fractious child, or when faced with several injured or very sick patients. To be effective, you should think in an orderly way by identifying the most urgent issue first, then running through in your mind the other issues to be considered. For each issue keep thinking: What are the facts (symptoms, signs, and test results)? What do I imagine is going on (the diagnoses)? What should I do (tests, treatments, and advice)? When you write down an account later, do so in response to the same questions. Within each of these questions, consider what is happening in each system. You can do this using sieves.'),\n",

It might be helpful to reflect on whether some other possibilities have been temporarily forgotten, or if some other conditions are present that might be caused or complicated by the diag- nostic possibilities considered already. This is when sieves can be useful. Reflect if there is something else that you should have considered in each system from a structural or func- tional point of view: - Social system (home, work, or environment) and locomotor function - Nervous system (psychiatric or neurological) - Cardiovascular system (physiological or structural) - Respiratory system (blood gas regulation or structural) - Gastrointestinal system (metabolic or GI tract) - Genitourinary system (reproductive or metabolic) - Skin and reticuloendothelial system - Endocrine and autonomic system Surgical diagnostic sieves If there is a structural abnormality, use the surgical sieve: - Congenital - Infective - Traumatic - Neoplastic - Degenerative There are many variations of these sieves.

So the distinction between a test and a treatment can be a fine one, and the same sieve can be applied to both. Look at each possibility triggered by the diagnostic sieve and consider if there is a test or treatment that you have forgotten by considering the following action sieve.

An ability to make a subjective diagnosis of degrees of well-being and imminent outcome depends on experience of observing a large number of patients and knowing what happened to them. There are early warning scores that you may be expected to use in some centers based on pulse, respiratory rate, and other factors. When you are being assessed by an examiner, do things deliberately so that you can be clearly seen to be doing the right thing. Students and many doctors are being assessed continuously during their day-to-day work, so there is much to be said for doing everything in a deliberate and transparent way at all times. The techniques of the physical examination are not covered in detail in this Oxford American Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis . However, the sequences of examination and documentation are described here. The skills themselves are best learned by watching experts, copying them, and practicing as much as possible. Consult books that specialize in describing practical examination techniques in detail. Watch others, read other books, and choose your own sequences.

Abnormal odors are also noted at this time, such as fruity breath in diabetic ketoacidosis, alcohol on the breath, the odors of urine or stool in incontinent patients. During the history, the order of questioning could be decided entirely by thought processes (for example, probing indirectly for a symptom to chase up a diagnostic possibility that comes to mind), but the physical examination is different. It is more efficient to adopt a routine that is smooth and quick and not to jump about looking for physical signs that might support the diagnostic idea of that moment. You have already been looking at the patient's face, general appearance, and immediate vicinity (e.g., walking stick, medication packets, etc.) when taking the history, so for the general examination, begin with the hands and work your way up by inspecting (and, when appropriate, palpating) the arms to the shoulders.

The cranial nerve sequence follows in their numbered sequence. Motor function can be assessed next, beginning with inspection for wast- ing and involuntary movements and then palpation, by testing tone and strength. The upper limbs are examined first and then the lower limbs. Sensation is then tested in the upper then lower limbs and, finally, coor- dination, reflexes, and gait. The order can be changed by addressing the area of abnormality sug- gested by the history. For example, if the patient complains of difficulty in walking, then it would be sensible to examine gait, then motor function and sensory function, and cranial nerves last.

Despite all of this, it is still possible that there could be agranulocytosis due to carbimazole sensitivity. However, the raised leukocyte count with 90% neutrophils excludes this diagnosis because a low or absent WBC is obviously a necessary condition for the diagnosis of agranulocytosis. There is no need, therefore, to stop the carbimazole immediately. The glycosuria and random blood sugar of 151 mg/dL makes the diagno- sis of diabetes mellitus (DM) probable. If the patient has no symptoms o f diabetes and an active intercurrent illness (as in this case), two fasting sugars >126 mg/dL would be needed to satisfy the World Health Organi- zation (WHO) criteria so that the diagnosis would be acceptable to other doctors. Look at the other positive findings and consider if they would all resolve if the acute follicular tonsillitis resolved. Use common sense, experience, and imagination from your knowledge of physiology. The only remaining problems would be the glycosuria, prior thyrotoxicosis, and the patient living alone when very ill.

At this point, you will have had an opportunity to note the patient's posture and gait in the consulting room (or as the patient moves around the bed on the ward). If the patient's face looks normal and moves normally during speech, then there is unlikely to be a cranial nerve abnormality. Ask the patient to hold both arms out to assess posture, perform a finger–nose test, tap each hand on the other in turn, show the motion used to unscrew lightbulbs, and tap each foot on the floor (or the examiner's hand if in bed); then do a heel–shin test with each leg. Finally, test the reflexes in the arms and legs. If all of these are normal (and, as emphasized already, there are no symptoms of neurological disorder), then there is no need to examine the nervous system further. If there is a symptom or sign of neurological disorder, the nervous system has to be examined carefully, perhaps beginning with the territory under suspicion.\"),\n",

              "   'CHAPTER 16 Musculoskeletal symptoms and signs 384 Approach to the patient with musculoskeletal complaints Patients with disorders of nerves, muscle, or the neuromuscular junction can present with a similar constellation of symptoms. Diseases of the nerve (e.g., polyneuropathy), muscle (e.g., myopathy), and neuromuscular junction (e.g., myasthenia gravis) may present with varying degrees of sensory loss and weakness. Nevertheless, specific patterns of sensory and motor disturbances help differentiate between disorders. Weakness can arise from dysfunction of nerve, neuromuscular junc- tion, or muscle, and may be a difficult symptom for patients to quantify and localize. Frequently, patients will complain of pain and associated weakness. However, since pain may limit the action and mobility of a joint, the finding of weakness in the setting of pain may not indicat e true neurological dysfunction. It is important to distinguish myalgias (muscle pain) from arthralgias (joint pain). Additionally, many musculoskeletal symptoms are part of a systemic illness, so constitutional symptoms are always important to elicit. For muscular complaints, the pattern of symptoms is important to ascertain: which muscle groups are involved (localized to one extremity, proximal vs. distal, etc.) and whether there is accompanying weakness. Family history may give you a clue (e.g., inherited muscle storage diseases or a family history of autoimmune disease). The degree of impairment of a c t i v i t i e s o f d a i l y l i v i n g s h o u l d a l w a y s b e p a r t o f a m u s c u l o s k e l e t a l assessment. For joint complaints, the pattern of joint involvement is also important and can give clues to the underlying illness. Monoarticular arthritis has a different differential diagnosis than that of polyarticular arthritis. Associated morning stiffness usually suggests inflammatory arthritis.'),\n",

              "   \"CHAPTER 16 Musculoskeletal symptoms and signs 386 Muscle weakness + pain Many patients who complain of weakness are not weak when muscle strength is formally tested. A careful history and physical examination will help in determining the distinction between asthenia (motor impairment due to pain or joint dysfunction) and true weakness. Patients with a variety of systemic disorders (cardiopulmonary and joint disease, anemia, cachexia, depression) may interpret difficulties in performing certain tasks as weakness. These patients may be functionally limited but not truly weak. True weakness due to a decrease in muscle power must be differentiated from limitation due to dyspnea, chest pain, joint pain, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, paresthesias, or spasticity. Muscle complaints should be further characterized by the muscle groups involved, exacerbation with exercise, and the presence of fasciculations. Muscle pain is relatively uncommon in patients with many types of myopathy and true weakness, but is often a problem for patients with overexertion, cramps, or fibromyalgia. The physical examination should include not only testing of muscle strength but also a careful search for one of the disorders that can cause the perception of weakness.

              "   'CHAPTER 19 Chest X-ray appearances 438 The general approach 1. Use optimal viewing conditions, preferably recessed lighting to avoid monitor glare. 2. Check the patient\\'s name, gender, age, and medical record number to ensure correct identity. 3. Check if the film is labeled PA (X-rays passing from posterior to anterior in a standard way) or AP (X-rays passing from anterior to posterior). AP views are commonly performed when the patient is ill, using a portable X-ray tube. These views will often be semi-erect films with suboptimal exposure factors. X-rays passing through the body from anterior to posterior magnify the mediastinum; therefore AP films should not be used to assess cardiac size or hilar configuration. 4. Check which sides are labeled left and right and whether the cardiac apex is on the left (if not, the patient may have dextrocardia). 5. Check the patient\\'s positioning. Are the sternoclavicular joints equi- distant from the spinous processes of the vertebral column? If not, then the patient was rotated. Rotation causes asymmetry of shoulder girdle muscles projected over the lung fields. Consequently, the side that has the less space between the end of the clavicle and spinous process has more muscle projected over the lung fields and is whiter than the other side. Be cautious in the interpretation of a rotated chest radiograph. 6. Check to see if the vertebral column is visible through the heart shadow. If not, then it is \"under-penetrated\" (the X-ray beam was too weak); normal lung tissue will look abnormally opaque (white). 7. Check to see if the lung fields appear dark. If they are, and the verte- bral column can be seen very clearly, and the heart shadow is vague, the film is \"over-penetrated,\" and abnormalities may be missed. 8. Check to ensure the diaphragm is between the fifth and sixth anterior rib ends. If it is higher, then the patient did not take a deep breath, and interpretation of the appearance of the lungs and mediastinum will be suboptimal. If the diaphragmatic domes are flattened, then emphysematous changes are likely. 9. After addressing the basic technical issues, are there objects in the X-ray that strike you immediately? Check for foreign bodies, e.g., endotracheal tubes, catheters, chest drains, etc. A striking radio- opaque (white) or lucent (dark) area is likely to be a good lead. 10. Assess the X-ray systematically for subtle abnormalities by: a. initially looking at the film without considering the clinical scenario. There is often a tendency to miss obvious things that do not fit with the differential diagnosis. Afterwards, review the X-ray again with the clinical information in mind. b. looking at each lung separately, starting at the base and progressing to the apex, carefully looking for abnormalities. Compare the left to the right lung by starting at the lung bases and progressing to the apices, scanning from the lateral border or the right lung to the lateral border of the left lung and back to the opposite side and repeating until the apices are reached. Look \"behind\" the heart and below the diaphragm.'),\n",

Note artifacts from skin folds, hair, clothing, and buttons. 11. Remember to compare any abnormal chest film with the patient's prior studies. Progression over time will often hold the key to the correct diagnosis. This chapter briefly describes common X-ray features of frequently encountered clinical chest diseases. Have the X-rays formally reviewed by a radiologist if you do not recognize a sign.

The \"silhouette sign\" consists of loss of normal demarcation between opaque (white) tissue and the normally darker (lucent) lung due to abnormal opacification of the lung.
